## What is Discover! Management Console?
Discover! Management Console is an administration suite we use for our games. It was created back in April of 2017. It became open source as Roblox changed how loading of closed-sourced modules in 2018.

## Why open source?
We have decided to open source Discover! Management Console as it relied on old technology which doesn't go well with modern standards. We also made it available for you to be inspired off the admin system, or freely modify the system in any shape or form.
